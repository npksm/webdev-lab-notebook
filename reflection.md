## Reflection Document

### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.

I found this first set of exercises straightforward.
Most of the content was covered in class, so that was helpful for completing this.

### Accessibility

The accessibility exercis was also fairly straightforward, but it was good practice with a form and helpful for using the accessibility audit as well.

### CSS

The CSS exercises started to get a little more complicated, where html elements and tags are fairly straightforward, selectors, classes, layout, and media-queries bring in more complications and nuance.
The exercises were useful for looking at small parts of these to see how they work.

### Flexbox

These definitely were the most challenging exercises so far.
A lot were fairly straightforward and just a matter of applying the flex, but one part of doing these exercises in this approach is trying to match an image can throw me off. I definitely was overcomplicating things or trying things that just made it more difficult. It definitely is helpful for learning, but in some ways felt frustrating to have the solutions be so simple.

### CSS Grid

I found these exercises fairly straightforward. Grid itself seems pretty intuitive and like a strong tool for layout.
I had actually been playing with a grid area for my form in homework 2 and was really struggling with getting it to work correctly, but then I came back and finished the grid-ara exercise and it really clarified what my problem was.

### Bootstrap

We had covered a lot of this content in class so it was fairly straightforward. I used the bootstrap website docs and it made this very easy. I thought that the modal would be more complicated, but the example on their site actually worked easily.

### JavaScript

This was definitely a switch in gears and some of these were pretty tricky.
Like how CSS felt like a shift from HTML, this was a pretty big shift.
They were really helpful though and I found them to be great examples of some of the things that are possible with javascript that I wouldn't have thought of, or would have wondered how to do.

### Jquery

Jquery felt like a more complicated JavaScript at first, but once I finished the exercises I saw how useful it is.
I still think there is a lot more to understand about it, and it will take some more practice to really use it, but this was a great introduction to it.
